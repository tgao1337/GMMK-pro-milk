# TommyGao's GMMK Pro layout

This is pretty much the stock layout with a few things moved around.

The differences are as follows:

- Short DEBOUNCE time (5 ms)
- Per-key debounce algorithm (sym_defer_pk)
- RGB turns off after 20 minutes of inactivity
- RGB turns off when USB is suspended
- Fn + PrintScreen is Calculator

# Encoder
Holding alt and scrolling encoder will allow scrolling through applications, as if using alt + tab  
Holding ctrl and scrolling encoder will allow scrolling through chrome tabs 
default encoder behavior is volume up/down  

This keymap also includes CAPS LOCK ON indicator.\
All left and right side LEDs, and the Caps key LED will turn solid red while CAPS LOCK is ON.

No other changes have been made. \
The other keys on each layer have been kept intact.
